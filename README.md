# map-widget

To change the tileset, you can choose from one of the previews here:

http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html

Because we're using [leaflet-providers](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers), you can simply replace the provider string in the code unless you choose a provider that requires registration and a token. See the previously linked README for more info.
